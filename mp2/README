README

This mp2 contains the following folder,

-mp2: contains the main file, udp_detection.go and README

-result: includes all the generated local files for the system (i.e result_vmq.txt). Need to rename or delete the log file if don't need the previous history. 
    
To start this system, 
Step 1:
Stay at this folder and run command "go run udp_detection.go" for all the nodes including introducer.

Step 2:
Except introducer, run command "join" and then the introducer will automatically build the whole network and run it.

Step 3:
If you want one machine to leave the network, run command "leave". The left node won't terminated, you can rejoin the network whenever you want by typing "join".

Step 4:
If you want one machine to exit without telling others (fail), you can directly use Crrl+C (SIGINT) or run command "exit". The failed node will terminated itself so you need to run "go run udp_detection.go" and "join" again to rejoin the network

Command: 

1. "mlist": 
	During anytime, you can type in "mlist" to print out the member lists for that node contained with the status and the corresponding time. (status 0: fail; status 1: alive; status 2: leave)

2. "nlist":
	During anytime, you can type in "nlist" to print out the neighbor lists for that node.

Sample usage:

If we have a four-node network, excute Step 1 and 2 firstly to set up the network. Type in "leave" at node i and that node will voluntarily leave. Type in "exit" or Crtl+C at node i will fail that node.
