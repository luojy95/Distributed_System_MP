README

This mp3 contains the following folder,

-mp3: contains the main file, sdfs.go and README

-result: includes all the generated local files for the system (i.e result_vmq.txt). Need to rename or delete the log file if don't need the previous history. 

-local_dir: includes all the local file. Only the file in this folder can be put (added) to the sdfs file system

-sdfs_dir: includes all the sdfs file. When restart or rejoin, all the sdfs will be removed.
    
To start this system, 
Step 1:
Stay at this folder and run command "go run sdfs.go" for all the nodes including master.

Step 2:
Except master, run command "join" and then the introducer will automatically build the whole network and run it.

Step 3:
Run command "exit" or simply Ctrl+C will kill the running node.

Command 1:
If you want one machine to leave the network, run command "leave". The left node won't terminated, you can rejoin the network whenever you want by typing "join".

Command 2:
If you want one machine to exit without telling others (fail), you can directly use Crrl+C (SIGINT) or run command "exit". The failed node will terminated itself so you need to run "go run udp_detection.go" and "join" again to rejoin the network

Command: 

1. "mlist": 
	During anytime, you can type in "mlist" to print out the member lists for that node contained with the status and the corresponding time. (status 0: fail; status 1: alive; status 2: leave)

2. "nlist":
	During anytime, you can type in "nlist" to print out the neighbor lists for that node.

3. "id":
	During anytime, you can type in "id" to get the VM id for the current machine.

4. "put xxx yyy"
	xxx: the name for the local file name, must be stored in the local_dir; otherwise a warning info will be printed out.
	yyy: the name for the sdfs file that we want the system to store.
	This command will add the local file: xxx to the system and store it as sdfs file: yyy

5. "get yyy xxx"
	yyy: the name for the sdfs file name, if not existed a warning info will be printed out.
	xxx: the name for the local file name, will be stored in the local_dir.

6. "ls yyy"
	List all the VMs that currently stores sdfs file yyy, typically use at master.

7. "delete yyy"
	Delete the sdfs file yyy and remove it from the sdfs system.

8. "store"
	List all the sdfs files currently stored at this machine.

9. "get-versions yyy num xxx"
	gets all the last num versions of the sdfs file yyy and store it as xxx into the local_dir. (deliminator "#==================#" will be used for segamentation purpose)
