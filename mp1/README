This mp1 contains the following folder,

-rpc_implementation: including all codes for the distributed grep system
    -mygrep:contains the class for grep class
    -rpc_client.go: client that send request to all servers and fetch back the result
    -start_server.go: server that accept and process the request, generate and send the result back to client.

-random log file: generate random log files for unit test
    -generate_log.go: generate log files with certain patterns.
    
To start this system, 
Step 1:
go to rpc_implementation and run command "go run start_server.go" in each VM to initialize server, the ip_addr of each VM will display after being intiated successfully.

Step 2:
In any VM, run command "go run rpc_client.go" with the following flag to start grep command
Input flag

-c: request of grep command, default -c "grep 0"

-a: options of grep command, default "-c"

-o: if "y", will output to terminal, "n" will direct the result to txt file, default "y"

-f: prefix of file name, default "./result"

-s: suffix (or type) of file to grep, default ".log"

-p: path to save the result, default "./result"

-sf, file name of result default "result_vm"

Sample usage:

If we grep result matched 0 from vm1.log, vm2.log..vm10.log located in "~/logs/" in each vm, and then save the matched line with number in ./result/result_vm1.txt, ./result/result_vm2...

we will run

go run rpc_client.go -c "grep app" -a "-Hn" -o "n" -f "~/logs/vm" -s ".log" -p "./result" -sf "result_vm"
